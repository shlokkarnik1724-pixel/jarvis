# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Cloud Agent development

- Install: `npm ci` (idempotent; uses `package-lock.json`).
- Dev server: `npm run dev` → http://127.0.0.1:3000 (started via `.cursor/environment.json` terminals).
- One-click demo (no Supabase): open `/demo` or POST `/api/demo/launch`, then tour Brain → Ingestion → Graph → Skills → Simulator.
- Demo credentials: `investor@demo.tactix.ai` / `demo1234`.
- Production build: `npm run build` then `npm run start`.
- Real auth requires Supabase env vars per `.env.example` and SQL in `supabase/`.
